MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION : Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information, by using TF-IDF techniques.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION: Building  a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION : Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

SPAM SMS DETECTION : Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
 Use techniques like TF-IDF with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages
